# Day 1: What is Machine Learning?

 Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" with data, without being explicitly programmed. This means that the computer can improve its performance on a task by learning from examples, instead of having a human programmer write specific instructions for every possible situation.

 For example, to create a spam email classifier, we would give the computer a dataset of emails labeled as spam or not spam, and the machine learning algorithm would learn from the data to identify characteristics that distinguish spam emails from non-spam emails.


 ## Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning

Traditional programming uses rules and instructions to achieve a specific outcome, while machine learning feeds the computer data to let it learn and find patterns to make predictions. For example, finding the sum of two numbers can be done through traditional programming by writing a program with specific instructions. In contrast, machine learning involves feeding a dataset of pairs of numbers and their corresponding sums to an algorithm that uses statistical techniques to analyze the data and find patterns to make predictions about new pairs of numbers. The main difference is that traditional programming explicitly tells the computer what to do, while machine learning teaches the computer through examples.


## Data Mining

Data Mining is the process of extracting useful information from large datasets. In the context of Machine Learning, data mining involves analyzing large amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships that can be used to make predictions.

For example, in our spam email example, we might use data mining techniques to analyze the emails and identify patterns that are common in spam emails. These patterns might include certain words or phrases, the time of day the email was sent, or the type of attachment included in the email. By identifying these patterns, we can create a model that can predict whether a new email is spam or not spam.


## History of Machine Learning

The concept of Machine Learning has been around for several decades. However, it wasn't until the last decade that it gained popularity due to the increasing availability of large datasets and powerful computers. Today, Machine Learning is used in a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, image processing, and autonomous vehicles.
