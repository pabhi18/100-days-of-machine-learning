# 100 Days of Machine Learning

Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning project! In this repository, I will document my journey as a beginner in the field of Machine Learning.

## What is this project about?

This project is a personal challenge to learn Machine Learning for 100 days straight. Every day, I will study, practice, and document what I have learned. My goal is to become proficient in the fundamentals of Machine Learning and develop practical skills that I can use in real-world projects.

## Why am I doing this?

I am doing this project to learn Machine Learning from scratch and gain hands-on experience in the field. As a beginner, I believe that the best way to learn is to practice and apply what I have learned. Through this project, I hope to build a strong foundation in Machine Learning that will enable me to tackle more advanced concepts in the future.

## What will I learn?

During this project, I will cover a range of topics related to Machine Learning, including:

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Supervised learning algorithms such as regression and classification
- Unsupervised learning algorithms such as clustering and dimensionality reduction
- Model evaluation and selection
- Deep Learning and Neural Networks
- Reinforcement Learning

## How to use this repository?

You can use this repository to follow along with my journey and learn Machine Learning alongside me. Each day, I will document what I have learned and provide code examples and datasets that you can use to practice on your own.

## How to contribute?

If you find any errors or have suggestions on how to improve my learning journey, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. I welcome all feedback and suggestions!

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank the entire Machine Learning community for their support and resources. Without their contributions, this project would not be possible.
